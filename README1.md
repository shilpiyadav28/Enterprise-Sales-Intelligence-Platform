# 📊 Enterprise Sales Intelligence Platform

An **end-to-end data warehouse and analytics solution** built using SQL Server and Power BI.
This project demonstrates how raw data from multiple enterprise systems can be transformed into a structured data warehouse to support **advanced analytics and business intelligence reporting**.

The system integrates data from **CRM and ERP systems**, processes it through **ETL pipelines**, and transforms it into an analytics-ready format using **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

The final output is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that enables stakeholders to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product insights.

# 🧩 Business Problem

Retail organizations often store sales data across multiple systems such as **CRM platforms and ERP systems**.
Because this data is fragmented across systems, it becomes difficult for business teams to analyze:

* Customer purchasing behavior
  
* Product performance
  
* Sales trends
  
* Revenue growth patterns

This project solves that problem by building a **centralized data warehouse** that integrates data from multiple sources and transforms it into a format optimized for **analytical reporting and decision making**.

# 🏗 Data Architecture

The project follows **Medallion Architecture**, a modern approach used in data engineering to organize data into multiple layers.

```

```

### Bronze Layer

* Stores raw data from CRM and ERP systems
* Data is loaded as-is from CSV files
* Maintains original data for traceability

### Silver Layer

* Performs data cleaning and standardization
* Handles missing values and duplicates
* Prepares structured datasets for analytics

### Gold Layer

* Contains business-ready data models
* Implements a **Star Schema design**
* Optimized for analytical queries and BI dashboards

# 🧠 Data Modeling

The Gold layer uses a **Star Schema** to support fast analytical queries.

```
               Dim_Customers
                    │
                    │
Dim_Date ───── Fact_Sales ───── Dim_Products
                    │
                    │
               Dim_Location
```

### Fact Table

**Fact_Sales**

Contains transactional sales data including:

* Order ID
  
* Product ID
  
* Customer ID
  
* Sales Amount
  
* Quantity
  
* Order Date

### Dimension Tables

* **Dim_Customers** → customer attributes
  
* **Dim_Products** → product attributes
  
* **Dim_Date** → time dimension
  
* **Dim_Location** → store/location information

This structure enables efficient analysis of **customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends**.
